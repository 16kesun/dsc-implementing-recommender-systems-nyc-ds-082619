The algorithm is named after Simon Funk, who was part of the team who placed 3rd in the Netflix challenge with this innovative way of performing matrix decomposition. Read more about Funk's SVD implementation at [his original blog post](https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html). There is no simple way to include for this fact with scipy's implementation of svd, but luckily the surprise library has Funk's version of SVD implemented to make our lives easier!\n",

You'll notice that the n_jobs parameter set to -1, which ensures that all of the cores on my computer will be used to process fitting and evaluating all of these models. To help keep track of what is occurring here, take note of the different values. This code ended up taking over 16 minutes to complete even with parallelization in effect, so the optimal parameters are given to you. Use them to train a model and let's see how well it performs.
